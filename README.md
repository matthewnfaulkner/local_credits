# Local Credit #

This plugin extends the functionality of Moodle badges, it requires the plugin local_shopping_cart to work.

Users with the correct capabilities can create credits. 

Credits are financial incentives for achieving badges.

On creation you choose a badge, and a total monetary credit.

When the user earns the badge, they also receive the credit. But only the first time!

The credits rely on the local_shopping_cart plugin, which stores the credit 
and allows the user to discount purchases to the value of their credit.
